## THEORY :

A Common Source (CS) amplifier is one of the fundamental MOSFET amplifier configurations.  
In this configuration, the source terminal is grounded, the input is applied at the gate and the output is taken from the drain.
The amplifier provides voltage gain with a phase inversion of 180 degrees between input and output.  
For proper amplification, the MOSFET must operate in the saturation region.  
Therefore, the Q-point is fixed such that VDS ≈ VDD/2 to allow maximum symmetrical output swing.


## PROCEDURE :

1. The 180nm NMOS model file (tsmc018.lib) was included in LTspice using the .include directive.

2. The Common Source amplifier circuit was constructed with:
   - VDD = 1.5 V  
   - Drain resistor RD ≈ 2.245 kΩ  
   - NMOS transistor with L = 180 nm and W = 2.5 µm    

3. DC analysis was performed using the .op and .dc commands to determine the Q-point by setting VDS ≈ VDD/2.

4. RD was adjusted and W/L ratio was varied to achieve the required drain current under the power constraint (P ≤ 0.5 mW).

5. Transient analysis (.tran 5m) was carried out using a sine input SINE(0.9 10m 1k) to observe linear and non-linear behavior.

6. AC analysis (.ac dec 10 0.1 100G) was performed to obtain frequency response and determine gain and bandwidth parameters.

## DC ANALYSIS AND DESIGN CALCULATIONS :

To design the Common Source amplifier, the Q-point was fixed at  
VDS ≈ VDD / 2 for maximum symmetrical output swing.

The device parameters were extracted from the model file (tsmc018.lib).

### Given Parameters (From tsmc018.lib)
 
- Vth = 0.366 V  
- Tox = 4.1 × 10⁻⁹ m  
- μn (U0) = 273.80 cm²/V·s  
- εr (SiO₂) = 3.9  
- ε0 = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m  
- Power constraint: P ≤ 0.5 mW  

Since the input DC bias at the gate is 0.9 V,

VGS = 0.9 V  

As VGS > Vth (0.9 V > 0.366 V),  
the NMOS operates in saturation region.

### Step 1: Calculate Drain Current Using Power Constraint

Using:

P = V × I  

0.5 × 10⁻³ = 1.5 × ID  

ID = (0.5 × 10⁻³) / 1.5  

ID ≈ 3.34 × 10⁻⁴ A  

ID ≈ 0.334 mA  

### Step 2: Fix Q-Point

For maximum symmetrical swing:

VDS = VDD / 2  

VDS = 1.5 / 2  

VDS ≈ 0.75 V  

### Step 3: Calculate Drain Resistor (RD)

RD = (VDD − VDS) / ID  

RD = (1.5 − 0.75) / (3.34 × 10⁻⁴)  

RD ≈ 2.245 kΩ  

### Step 4: Calculate Oxide Capacitance (Cox)

First calculate oxide permittivity:

εox = εr × ε0  

εox = 3.9 × (8.854 × 10⁻¹²)  

εox ≈ 3.45 × 10⁻¹¹ F/m  

Now,

Cox = εox / Tox  

Cox = (3.45 × 10⁻¹¹) / (4.1 × 10⁻⁹)  

Cox ≈ 8.41 × 10⁻³ F/m²  

### Step 5: Calculate Process Transconductance Parameter (kn')

Convert mobility to SI units:

μn = 273.80 cm²/V·s  
= 0.02738 m²/V·s  

Now,

kn' = μn × Cox  

kn' = 0.02738 × (8.41 × 10⁻³)  

kn' ≈ 2.30 × 10⁻⁴ A/V²  

### Step 6: Calculate Required Transistor Width (W)

Using MOSFET saturation equation:

ID = (kn'/2) × (W/L) × (VGS − Vth)²  

Given:

VGS = 0.9 V  
Vth = 0.366 V  

(VGS − Vth) = 0.534 V  

L = 180 nm = 180 × 10⁻⁹ m  

Substituting:

3.34 × 10⁻⁴ = (2.30 × 10⁻⁴ / 2) × (W / 180 × 10⁻⁹) × (0.534)²  

Solving,

W ≈ 1.83 µm  

After simulation tuning to obtain accurate Q-point:

Final selected width:

W = 2.5 µm  


### DC Operating Point from LTspice

ID ≈ 0.33 mA  
VDS ≈ 0.75 V  

Thus, the Q-point is successfully fixed near mid-supply.
### DC Simulation Result

## DC PARAMETER VARIATION STUDY :

### (a) Effect of Varying RD (For Fixed W/L)

The width and length of the transistor were kept constant (W = 2.5 µm, L = 180 nm).  
The drain resistor RD was varied to observe its effect on the Q-point.

Observation:

- Increasing RD increases the voltage drop across RD.
- As RD increases, VDS decreases.
- Drain current slightly reduces for larger RD values.
- Proper RD selection is required to maintain VDS ≈ VDD/2.

Thus, RD ≈ 2.245 kΩ was selected to obtain VDS ≈ 0.75 V.

### DC Sweep Result

The DC sweep of input voltage was performed from 0 V to 1.5 V to observe variation in supply current and verify the power constraint.

![DC Sweep Current](dc_sweep.png)


---

### (b) Effect of Varying W (For Fixed RD)

The drain resistor was kept constant at RD ≈ 2.245 kΩ.  
The transistor width (W) was varied to analyze its effect on drain current.

Observation:

- Increasing W increases drain current.
- Larger W shifts the Q-point due to higher ID.
- Smaller W reduces ID and moves VDS closer to VDD.

From simulation tuning, W = 2.5 µm provided the required drain current (≈ 0.33 mA) and correct biasing.
### DC Transfer Characteristic (Vout vs Vin)

The DC sweep was performed by varying input voltage from 0 V to 1.5 V.  
The variation of output voltage with respect to input voltage is shown below.

![DC Transfer Curve](dc_transfer.png)

---

## TRANSIENT ANALYSIS :

Transient simulation was performed using:

.tran 5m

A sine input of SINE(0.9 10m 1k) was applied at the gate terminal.

### Input Waveform (Vin)

![Input Waveform](vin_transient.png)

### Output Waveform (Vout)

![Output Waveform](vout_transient.png)

### Combined Input and Output Waveforms

![Transient Combined Vin and Vout](Transient_Vin_Vout.png)


### Observation

- Output waveform is inverted with respect to input (≈ 180° phase shift).
- Peak output voltage ≈ 780 mV
- Peak input variation ≈ 10 mV
- Voltage gain ≈ 2.08
- The amplifier operates in saturation region.

Thus, transient analysis confirms proper biasing and amplification.

...

### Gain Calculation (From Transient Analysis)

From the transient waveform:

Voltage Gain (Av) = Vout / Vin  

Peak-to-peak values were measured from the graph.

Output voltage:

Vout(max) = 779.52 mV  
Vout(min) = 739.08 mV  

Vout(pp) = 779.52 − 739.08  
Vout(pp) = 40.44 mV  

Input voltage:

Vin(max) = 909.56 mV  
Vin(min) = 890.187 mV  

Vin(pp) = 909.56 − 890.187  
Vin(pp) = 19.373 mV  

Therefore,
Av = Vout(pp) / Vin(pp)  

Av = 40.44 / 19.373  
Av ≈ 2.0877 V/V

Gain in dB:

Av(dB) = 20 log(Av)  

Av(dB) = 20 log(2.0877)  
Av(dB) ≈ 6.39 dB  

### Theoretical Gain Calculation

For a Common Source amplifier:

Av = gm × RD  
gm = 2ID / (VGS − Vth)

Given:

ID = 0.33 mA  
VGS = 0.9 V  
Vth = 0.366 V  
RD = 2.245 kΩ  

Overdrive voltage:

Vov = VGS − Vth = 0.9 − 0.366 = 0.534 V  

Transconductance:

gm = (2 × 0.33 × 10⁻³) / 0.534  
gm ≈ 1.236 mS  

Therefore,

Av = gm × RD  
Av = (1.236 × 10⁻³) × (2245)  
Av ≈ 2.78 V/V 

Gain in dB:

Av(dB) = 20 log(2.78)  
Av(dB) ≈ 8.88 dB  

The simulated gain (2.087) is lower than the theoretical value due to channel length modulation, output resistance effects, and other non-ideal device characteristics.

----

## AC ANALYSIS : 

AC analysis was performed using:

.ac dec 10 0.1 100G

The frequency response was obtained to determine gain and bandwidth.

### Observations

- The amplifier shows constant gain in the midband region.
- At higher frequencies, gain decreases due to parasitic capacitances.
- The presence of load capacitor (CL = 1 pF) reduces the bandwidth.

### Extracted Parameters

From AC plot (with CL = 1 pF):

- Midband gain ≈ 2.087
- Gain in dB ≈ 6.39 dB
- 3 dB bandwidth ≈ 89.65 MHz
- Unity Gain Bandwidth (UGB) ≈ 150.23 MHz
- GBP ≈ 2.087 × 89.65 MHz
     ≈ 187 MHz (approx)

# DC Analysis

### Drain Current Calculation

Power constraint:

P = VDD × ID  

0.5 mW = 1.5 × ID  

ID = 0.333 mA  

---

### NMOS (M1) Design

Given:

VGS = 0.9 V  
Vthn = 0.366 V  

Overdrive voltage:

VOV = VGS − Vth  

VOV = 0.9 − 0.366  

VOV = 0.534 V  

Using drain current equation:

ID = (1/2) kn' (W/L) (VOV)²  

kn' = 2.30 × 10⁻⁴ A/V²  
L = 180 nm  

Solving for W:

Wn ≈ 1.8 µm  

---

### PMOS (M2) – Diode Connected Load

For PMOS:

ID = (1/2) kp' (Wp/L) (VSG − |Vthp|)²  

Given:

ID = 0.333 mA  
kp' = 9.73 × 10⁻⁵ A/V²  
L = 180 nm  
VOV = 0.534 V  

Since,

VOV = VSG − |Vthp|

Substituting:

0.333 × 10⁻³  
= (1/2)(9.73 × 10⁻⁵)(Wp / 180×10⁻⁹)(0.534)²  

(0.534)² = 0.285  

0.333 × 10⁻³  
= 1.386 × 10⁻⁵ (Wp / 180×10⁻⁹)

Solving:

Wp ≈ 4.3 µm

### Output Voltage Calculation

For diode-connected PMOS:

VSG = VOV + |Vthp|  

VSG = 0.534 + 0.39  

VSG ≈ 0.924 V  

Output voltage:

Vout = VDD − VSG  

Vout = 1.5 − 0.924  

Vout ≈ 0.58 V  

---

### DC Width Tuning (Based on Simulation)

Initial calculated widths:

Wn(initial) = 1.8 µm  
Wp(initial) = 4.3 µm  

After running DC operating point analysis in LTspice, the output voltage was adjusted to obtain proper saturation and better bias point.

Final tuned widths:

Wn(tuned) = 2.88 µm  
Wp(tuned) = 6.88 µm  

For these tuned values:

ID = 0.333 mA  
Vout = 0.54 V  

The tuning was required because practical device behavior (including channel length modulation and model parameters from tsmc018.lib) slightly shifts the DC operating point from theoretical calculation.

![CS Amplifier Circuit](dccircuitb.png)

###  Saturation Condition Validation

For NMOS:

VGS > Vth  
0.9 V > 0.366 V ✅  

VDS ≥ VOV  

For PMOS:

VSG > |Vthp|  
0.924 V > 0.39 V ✅  

Hence both transistors operate in saturation region.

#  Comparison with Circuit 1

| Parameter | Circuit 1 (Current Source Load) | Circuit 2 (Diode Load) |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Gain | Higher | Lower |
| Output Resistance | High | Low |
| Bandwidth | Lower | Higher |
| Output Swing | Better | Limited |

Reason:

• Diode-connected PMOS behaves like a resistive load.  
• Output resistance reduces.  
• Voltage gain decreases.  
• Due to gain–bandwidth tradeoff, bandwidth improves.

---

# Effect of Channel Length Modulation (CLM)

In practical MOSFETs, drain current slightly increases with VDS due to channel length modulation.

This introduces finite output resistance (ro), reducing practical gain compared to ideal theoretical value.

Actual gain:

Av = -gm (ro || RD)

Hence simulated gain is slightly lower than theoretical gain.

#  DC Analysis

###  Drain Current Calculation

P = VDD × ID  

0.5 mW = 1.5 × ID  

ID = 0.333 mA  

---

###  NMOS (M1)

Assume overdrive voltage:

VOV = 0.25 V  

VGS = VOV + Vth  

VGS = 0.25 + 0.366  

VGS = 0.616 V  

Drain current equation:

ID = (1/2) × kn' × (W/L) × (VOV)²  

Substituting values and solving:

Wn ≈ 8.3 µm  

---

###  PMOS (M2)

ID = (1/2) × kp' × (W/L) × (VOV)²  

Solving similarly:

Wp ≈ 19.7 µm  

---

###  Bias Voltage (VB)

VSG = VOV + |Vthp|  

VSG = 0.25 + 0.39  

VSG = 0.64 V  

VB = VDD − VSG  

VB = 1.5 − 0.64  

VB = 0.86 V  

---

###  Output Voltage

For NMOS saturation:

VDS = VOV  

Since source is grounded:

Vout = 0.25 V  

---

###  Saturation Check

For NMOS:

VDS = 0.25 V  
VOV = 0.25 V  

Condition satisfied → NMOS in saturation  

For PMOS:

VSD = 1.5 − 0.25 = 1.25 V  
VSD > VOV  

Condition satisfied → PMOS in saturation  
Hence both transistors operate in saturation region.
